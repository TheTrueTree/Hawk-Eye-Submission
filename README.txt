Hello! I hope you're doing well. Here is some quick information about the game.

Running:
This game is a text-game made in python. As such, any version of python 3 being installed means that you should be able to run the game with no issues.

Premise:
The brief was to make a card game like higher or lower. I decided that as it would take too much time to sort a GUI out that would be meaningfully good looking. As such I focused on trying to make it a bit more fun.
It is a very basic game still, but influenced by games like Balatro, Inscryption and the like, it takes the form of an adventure. The main mechanics being that you begin with a standard deck, then have to battle enemies in order
to steal their cards to improve your own deck. You are also able to burn cards to increase your health.

Gameplay:
-> Pick between 1 - 3 randomly generated events (Only 2 possible events currently coded, Fire and Fight)
	-> Fire:
		-> 3 cards are randomly drawn. Pick one to discard. You gain health equivelant to the value of the card.
	-> Fight:
		-> Opponent has randomly generated health, but standard deck
		-> Both draw 5 cards to begin with, then 1 extra every round.
		-> Player and opponent play cards (Pure higher/lower, suits do not effect anything at the moment)
			-> There is an option to shuffle, but it allows a free shot from the opponent
		-> Winner inflicts the difference in score on the loser
		-> Continues untill one is defeated.
		-> Winner can steal one of three randomly drawn cards from the loser.
	-> Loop

Improvements:
	- The game is essentially a proof of concept. It is unbalanced (A standard deck means that on playtesting, it can become very hard), and the story is not fleshed out. However, these both could take more time. Other features I
	considerted was to implement an in game cheat mechanic, where you could insert cards into your opponents deck. Essentially leaning more into the RPG side of things

Conclusions:
Overall, was good fun! Thank you, and do let me know any critiques you've got.

All the best,
Trevor
